## Part 1: Key Terms and Concepts

#### Core Concepts and Key Terms

1. **API (Application Programming Interface)**: Understanding the basic concept, functionality, and purpose of APIs in software development.
    
2. **Interface**: The definition and role of interfaces in technology, and how they differ from APIs.
    
3. **API Components**: Learning the key components that make up an API.
    
4. **Types of APIs**: Differentiating between various types of APIs and their specific roles and applications in technology.
    
5. **Remote (Web) APIs**: Understanding how Remote APIs function, including their request-response mechanism.
    
6. **Client-Server Model**: Grasping the fundamentals of the web, particularly the client-server model, and how APIs operate within this framework.
    
7. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: Learning the basics of RESTful APIs, including their core principles and applications.
    
8. **API Exploration and Implementation**: Basic operations of online APIs, exploring specific API implementations, and hands-on interaction with API tools.
    
9. **Command-Line API Interaction**: Using command-line tools for API interaction, understanding API authentication methods, and parsing API responses.
    
10. **Curl**: Understanding and using Curl for API interactions, including basic commands and its application in API requests.
    
11. **API Exploration Tools**: Discovering and using various tools for API exploration and interaction, and their application in real-world scenarios.
    
12. **Helper Libraries**: Understanding the role and usage of helper libraries in API interactions and their implementation in programming.

### Your Chosen Terms

**Term/Concept 1:** API
**Definition:**  An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

**My Understanding (Rate 1-5):** 5  

**Example/Application:** An example of an API is the Google Maps API, which allows developers to integrate mapping functionality into their own applications. Through the API, developers can access features such as displaying maps, getting directions, and searching for locations within their own applications.

**Term/Concept 2:** Interface

**Definition:** An interface is a boundary across which two independent systems meet and communicate. It can be a hardware interface, where hardware devices connect and interact, or a software interface, where software components interact with each other.  

**My Understanding (Rate 1-5):** 4  

**Example/Application:** A common example of a software interface is a graphical user interface (GUI) in an operating system, which allows users to interact with the computer through visual elements such as windows, buttons, and menus.

**Term/Concept 3:** REST (Representational State Transfer)  

**Definition:** REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, typically HTTP. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform operations on resources.  

**My Understanding (Rate 1-5):** 4  

**Example/Application:**  An example of a RESTful API is the Twitter API, which allows developers to access and interact with Twitter's resources, such as tweets, users, and trends, using standard HTTP methods.

**Term/Concept 4:** Client-Server Model 

**Definition:** The client-server model is a computing architecture that divides tasks between clients, which request services or resources, and servers, which provide services or resources. Clients send requests to servers, and servers respond to those requests. 

**My Understanding (Rate 1-5):** 4 

**Example/Application:** When you browse the web, your web browser acts as the client, sending requests for web pages to servers hosting those pages. The servers then respond by sending the requested web pages back to your browser for display.

**Term/Concept 5:** Curl 

**Definition:** Curl is a command-line tool for transferring data using various network protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. It allows users to make requests to servers and retrieve data from web APIs directly from the command line.  

**My Understanding (Rate 1-5):** 3  

**Example/Application:** An example of using Curl is to retrieve weather data from a weather API. By issuing a Curl command with the appropriate parameters and endpoint, you can fetch current weather information and display it in your terminal.

## Part 2: Self-Assessment Checklists

**Understanding of Key Topics**
- I can explain the main concepts of this module - YES
- I can give examples of each key term/concept - YES
- I can apply these concepts to solve problems - YES

**Skills and Application**
- I can demonstrate the skills taught in this course in a practical context - YES
- I have practiced these skills through exercises or projects - YES
- I can critique or analyze scenarios using these concepts - YES

## Part 3: Reflective Questions

**What was the most interesting thing I learned in this module?**  

One of the most interesting I have learned in this moduleis about APIs and their ability to enable seamless integration and interaction between different software systems and services. APIs essentially act as bridges, allowing developers to access and leverage functionalities of other applications or platforms without needing to understand their underlying implementation details.

**What topic or concept did I find most challenging? Why?**  
Understanding REST Principles. While RESTful APIs are widely used and relatively simple in concept, understanding and properly applying the principles of REST were a bit difficult for me. I couldn't fully grasp concept such as statelessness, uniform interface, and resource-based architecture.

**How can I apply what I've learned from this course to real-life situations or other subjects?**  
With the information learned, one can design and develop applications that leverage APIs to access external services or data sources. Or, design and implement RESTful APIs for your own services or platforms. 

**Do I have any questions or areas where I need more clarification?**  
None

## Part 4: Action Plan

**Areas for Improvement:**  
Rest and curl. At first it was able to understand the concepts in detail but day by day I am getting better.

**My Action Plan:**  
Research more about these concepts to gain deeper understanding on their capabilities and how they can be used at the optimal level.
